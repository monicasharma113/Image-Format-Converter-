     <h3>PNG to JPG Conversion</h3><br/>
      JPEG and PNG are two different types of format used to store the images. JPEG: It stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. Extensions used to store image in this format are .jpg and .jpeg. It uses lossy compression algorithm, it means some of the image data is lost but image size is reduced.<br/> PNG: It stands for Portable Network Graphics. For PNG images extension used is .png. It uses lossless compression algorithm so image size is generally large. </p>
    <p><h3>Why should you convert PNG to JPG?</h3><br/>
      If you have a PNG file, there will be some things you can’t do with it. For example, you cannot have it professionally printed. Since PNG files do not contain CMYK color information, a professional printing company won’t accept them.<br/>
      
      Additionally, PNG files contain transparency spaces. This allows for pixels within the image to be completely empty. If you try to print a PNG or upload it to certain places on the web, those empty spaces could be filled with black or white pixels, which would make the image look much different than you would expect.<br/>
      
      This is why converting a PNG to JPG could be very useful. JPG files don’t support transparency, so you’ll know exactly what an upload will look like before you upload it. Also, JPGs support CMYK colors, so you can print them with high accuracy.</p>

  <p><h3>Is it safe to convert PNGs to JPGs?</h3><br/>
        When you use our tool to convert files, we create a copy of your original. The original source file on your computer, phone, or tablet remains untouched. So it is completely safe to use this tool as your original file will not change.<br/>
        
        Likewise, we never keep your copied files for more than an hour. One hour after you upload a file, we erase everything. Therefore, you can be content in knowing that we never keep your sensitive data.</p>
